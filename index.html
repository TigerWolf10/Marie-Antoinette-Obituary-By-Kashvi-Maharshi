        <h2>Life</h2>
        <p>Marie Antoinette was born on 2 November 1755. She was born an Archduchess of Austria, and was the youngest daughter of Empress Maria Theresa and Emperor Francis I. She married Louis XVI when she was 14, in 1770.She lived at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, but also spent much of her childhood in  Schönbrunn, their summer home in Vienna. She was not an academic child, being unable to write correctly in German or any other language commonly used in court at the time, however she was a good musician; she learned to play harp, harpsichord and flute. She was also a talented dancer, and was very fond of dolls. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>People's opinion on her</h2>
        <p>Marie Antoinette, soon after her marrige to the king, became increasingly unpopular due to her reputation of living an excessively lavish and wasteful lifestyle, gambling and rumours of having many affairs and illegitimate children. She was also suspected of harboring sympathies for enemies of Frane - particularly her homeland of Austria. She was ignorant and frivolous with money, whilst most of the general public suffered due to starvation and poverty. But despite all this, she was already distrusted by the French people due to her Austrian heritage, and this was only further fueled by all the rumours and her extravagant lifestyle. The intense despising may not entirely be down to only her personality, but may be in fact partially attributed to the bias that she was indisposed to; her Austrian heritage.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So whilst I believe she was not entirely blameless, in fact going so far as to say she played a key part of her execution due to her ignorance, living rather profligately and allegedly engaging in adultrous activies, she was also not entirely responsible for her execution. The French people were already indisposed to her due to her Austrian heritage; the reason she was detested may have something to do with her homeland, as opposed to only being down to her as a person. </p>
